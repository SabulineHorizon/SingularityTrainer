# RotKCutsceneSkip

This program is intended to be used to skip FMV cutscenes in the 2003 game Lord of the Rings: Return of the King.

While it is running, this program will search for the rotk.exe process. If the process is found and the memory address matches what it expects, it will modify the process memory.
